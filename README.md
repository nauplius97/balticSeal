Stockholm University postdoc project 2016-2017 

Data for quantification of predation effects on Baltic fish stocks by grey seal with EwE.  

The data comprises all input (1974-2015) and output daya (2016-2098)for all the scenarios.  

Scenarios:  

  Eastern Baltic cod fishing mortality scenarios: 
    Fcod = 1 
    Fcod = 0.3  

  Seal biomass scenarios: 
    seal0 = no grey seal after 2016. 
    seal1 = grey seal biomass stable after 2016 
    seal100 = grey seal biomass up to 50x the biomass in 1974  

  Environmental scenarios: (See description in Ambio paper). 
    BAU, BSP, REF, WAR1, WAR2, PRS.
